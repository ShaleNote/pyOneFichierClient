# pyOneFichierClient

This is a async version library designed for easy interaction with the [1Fichier API](https://1fichier.com/api.html).

For synchronous version, see original [pyOneFichierClient](https://github.com/spookyahell/pyOneFichierClient).

## Usage

If you're interested in how to use it in your own project you can have a look at [test_cli.py](pyOneFichierClient/test_cli.py)
<br /> which also functions as a nice executable module...

You can install it from github!
<br />`pip install git+https://github.com/ShaleNote/pyOneFichierClient.git`
<br />Spread the word! On Twitter and all the other shitty places on this thing we like calling internet.

Just need to be in the parent dir of the entire project and run `python -m pyOneFichierClient` and the interactive client will launch...

If you want to know what you can already do with this version of the API, you can also check out [API Endpoints](TODO.md#api-endpoints)
